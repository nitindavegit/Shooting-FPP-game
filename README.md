🟢 FPP Shooter – UE5 Prototype Game  
This is my first **First-Person Shooter** prototype made with Unreal Engine 5, set in a military container-style map. Built entirely using Blueprints!

Players must aim and shoot down targets to score points, while enjoying immersive visuals and sounds in a well-structured gameplay loop.
